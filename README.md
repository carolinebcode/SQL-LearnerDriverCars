My project analysis comparing cars for learner drivers

I undertook this project as my assessment for the Code First Girls course on Data and SQL. I noticed that there was not a comparison website that featured all the different considerations that a new learner driver would need to buy a car.

Therefore, I used Admiral and Google to find my data on cars that learner drivers could consider. I included features such as insurance premiums, car colours, door numbers, price, horsepower and CO2 emissions.

I created a view to see multiple features in one table to make comparisons easier and I also created a stored function to judge insurance premiums with a platinum, gold or silver car rating system
